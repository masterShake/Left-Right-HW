			        			<p class="card-text"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat does the future look like for anti-fraud professionals? ACFE President and CEO Bruce Dorris, J.D., CFE, CPA, highlighted three trends that we can expect to see over the next few years and into the next decade at the <em class="italic">29</em><sup>th</sup><em class="italic"> Annual ACFE Global Fraud Conference</em>, June 18-22, in Las Vegas. The first was technology.</p>

			        		<div class="card-body">
			        			<p class="card-text">“The way in which we learn today is far different and much faster than ever before,” said Dorris. “I can vividly recall what this meant to me 25 years ago when I was in law school. I remember studying in a musty, old, dark library in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I reviewed handwritten notes and books to study for my exams; two things that may seem archaic to us now. And when I worked in the financial industry years ago, you had to call into your broker to buy and sell a stock. Now, you can make a trade directly from your phone.”</p>

			        	</div>
			        </div>

			        	<div class="card">
			        		<div class="card-body">
			        			<p class="card-text">Dorris focused on emerging technologies that represent both risks and opportunities in the fight against fraud. In particular, there’s been a remarkable surge in public interest and investment in virtual currencies such as bitcoin. Dorris explained that developments like these don’t just provide new opportunities for fraudsters. Governments and businesses around the world are moving to capitalize on the fraud-fighting potential of blockchain technology. It promises to help detect and prevent payment fraud, securities fraud, fraud in the supply chain and identity theft. Likewise, artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly becoming indispensable tools for detecting suspicious transactions, enhancing cybersecurity measures, and streamlining fraud examinations.</p>
			        			<p class="collapse card-text" id="collapse-3">The second trend Dorris highlighted was data. “Data is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity for businesses and fraudsters alike, making information a priority in the fight against fraud,” he said. “While there are plenty of fraudsters casting wide nets for small pay-offs, many are changing tactics to leverage information into more targeted attacks with higher payoffs.”</p>

			        			<p class="card-text">Dorris told attendees that they have two roles to play with this data. They’re both the gatekeepers and the miners. “It will be up to you to remain vigilant in the protection of data and also the valuable use that this information provides,” he said.</p>
			        			<p class="collapse card-text" id="collapse-4">Finally, Dorris highlighted the third trend: collaboration. “From fusion centers and cybertech accords to cooperative, formalized agreements between regulators, law enforcement and prosecutors, we have already seen the value that working together has in a battle where the enemy often seems one step ahead,” he said. “In fact, collaboration might be the reason why you are at this event. Whether you are here for the first or 20<sup class="superscript">th</sup> time, you know that coming here will put you in contact with people from all over the world. ... Don’t be afraid to break down barriers of communication and information-sharing so that, together, we can become stronger.”</p>

			        			<p class="card-text">Cressey Award recipient Sir Rob Wainwright, former director of Europol, believes Europe is losing the fight against dirty money, but it could make great strides if law enforcement and investigative sectors “power up their cooperation” in information sharing and intelligence across all borders. “In the last two years I’ve been exorcised by how we’ve failed to adequately deal with the flows of dirty money in our international financial system,” he said during his Monday Opening Session address.</p>

			        			<p class="card-text">“We’ve all had the right vision the last two or three decades,” he said. But for all the billions spent on fighting money laundering, Europe is seeing only a 1 percent annual return. “It’s no better in the United States. No better in Australia. The design is wrong in my opinion,” he said. “Instead of focusing the intelligence efforts on identifying the most likely offenders we base our system on voluminous high-end transaction monitoring. …</p>
			        			<p class="collapse card-text" id="collapse-12">“So, we need to wake up the system and work together in order that the banks, and the regulators and the governments and legislatures, understand that the great vision we have isn’t working. We’ve designed this compliance system, and it’s become an end in itself. … The compliance regime is very powerful; I just think it needs to be used in a different way.”</p>
